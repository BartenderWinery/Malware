## Attention!
Most of these malware files are completely harmless and are meant as jokes, however, regardless of the safety, I suggest that you should completely read the source code before running any one of these scripts. I am not liable for any accidental damage done to your computer, it's probably never a good idea to download things from a folder that's called malware.
